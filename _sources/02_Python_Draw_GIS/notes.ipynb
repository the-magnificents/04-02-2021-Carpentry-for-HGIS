    "These lesson is part of an [open educational resource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources) or module. It is designed to be used in the context of the other lessons, and builds up knowledge, excercises and concepts using previous lessons as a foundation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with a program that works, to give a full picture, run first source code, then inspect the source code, and try to understand it step by step througout the lesson. The instructor will be reflecting between essential concepts of python and progressively reviewing the code on the basis of the new concepts taught. Therefore the instructor will go back to the source code provided and ask students about specific lines of code.\n",

    "## Run time\n",
    "In computer science, runtime, run time, or execution time is the final phase of a computer program's life cycle, in which the code is being executed on the computer's central processing unit (CPU) as machine code. In other words, \"runtime\" is the running phase of a program.\n",

    "## Computer memory:\n",
    "RAM is the primary or main memory of computer. It is the place where the text, data, instructions and intermediate results are stored while executing a program. The total memory is organized into number of bytes and each byte is again divided into 8 bits.\n"
