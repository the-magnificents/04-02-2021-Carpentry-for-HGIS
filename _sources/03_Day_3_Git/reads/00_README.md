#### **Version control**
In software engineering, version control (also known as revision control, source control, or source code management) is a class of systems responsible for managing changes to computer programs, documents, large web sites, or other collections of information.

At the simplest level, developers could simply retain multiple copies of the different versions of the program, and label them appropriately. This simple approach has been used in many large software projects. While this method can work, it is inefficient as many near-identical copies of the program have to be maintained. This requires a lot of self-discipline on the part of developers and often leads to mistakes. [Version Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control)

#### **Testing**
In software testing, test automation is the use of software separate from the software being tested to control the execution of tests and the comparison of actual outcomes with predicted outcomes. Test automation can automate some repetitive but necessary tasks in a formalized testing process already in place, or perform additional testing that would be difficult to do manually.[Test automation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_automation)

#### **Git repository**
Version control uses a repository (a database of changes) and a working copy where you do your work.


#### **Git**
Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development.[Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)

#### **Commit**
In version control systems, a commit is an operation which sends the latest changes to the source code to the repository, making these changes part of the head revision of the repository.


#### Github
GitHub, Inc. is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git, plus its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, continuous integration and wikis for every project.[Github](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub)

#### **Push**
The "push" command is used to publish new local commits on a remote server.
